										<h2>About me</h2>

									</header>
								<p> My name is Sébastien Lozano-Forero, Professor, Mathematician, Statistician and researcher. Experienced in higher education management, teaching and data analysis.</p>
								<p> As of today, I work as Data Analyst at the Lambton College, located in beautiful South Western Ontario (Canada), and as Remote Professor at Los Libertadores University Foundation (Colombia). At the college, my job consists on delivering better ways to present information to stakeholders, faculty and managers and thus, contributing to the decision making process and overall student well being, by means of data products deployment. </p>
								<p> As my passion for education (and learning) only grows with time, I'm looking forward to expand my areas of expertise including other industries while being able to propose and deploy data related products.<br/>

											<h3> Public Transportation Dynamics (Valle de Aburra, Colombia)</h3>
											<p> This project aimed to contribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aburr%C3%A1_Valley">Aburrá Valley </a> (Colombian region of about 4M inhabitants) authorities to understand public transportation dynamics, by means of a real-time dashboard, in order to enhanced quality, efficiency and proactively propose future infrastructure projects. Also, Neural networks were used to forecast heavy transit points. All programming was carried out with Python. </p>

											<h3> Dissecting and forecasting food inflation (Colombian case)</h3>

											<p> This project aimed to propose a suitable approach based on classic statistics to better forecast food inflation in Colombia based on prices collected diretly from food marketplaces across the country. Being able to proactively anticipate food prices variation lead to better decision making by authorities and food merchants. It involves heavy data wranling and processing, classical univariate and multivariate time Series models (SARIMA, SVAR and SVEC). All programming was carried out in R. </p>

											<h3> Predicting Sales </h3>
											<p> This project presents a solution for a Kaggle competition where forecasted selling values were required by a large drugstore. Among various Machine Learning techniques, XGboost was selected, implemented and deployed. All programming was carried out in python. Deployment was carried out using Flaks and Heroku. </p>
